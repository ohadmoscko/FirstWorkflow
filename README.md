# FirstWorkflow â€“ Secure Webhook Form

Single-file HTML page that posts quotes to a Make.com webhook. Enter your **Webhook URL** and **Secret** once, click **Save Config** (stored locally in your browser), then use **Send Test Ping** or **Request a Quote**.  
Make scenario validates the secret and writes rows to **FirstWorkflow_Quotes / Sheet1** in Google Sheets.  
> Do **not** hard-code secrets in the HTML; the page stores them only in localStorage on your device.

**Live (GitHub Pages):** Settings â†’ Pages â†’ Deploy from branch â†’ `main` / root, then visit `https://<your-username>.github.io/FirstWorkflow/`.
Field alignment: the page sends `name`, `scope`, `ts` to match the Make mapping.
