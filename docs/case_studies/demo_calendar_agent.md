# Demo – Calendar Agent

**Goal:** Show how the agents prepare an event plan.

**Steps:**
1) Idea → collect event inputs (who/what/when)
2) Strategy → propose structure (title, agenda, materials)
3) Risk Auditor → check conflicts/constraints
4) SheetSmith → create a schedule grid
5) Closer → finalize a calendar/event brief

**Result:** A ready-to-review event plan suitable for calendar entry.
